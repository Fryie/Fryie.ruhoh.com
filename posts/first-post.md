I've just decided that I need a blog. Or at least I think I do. Since nowadays it's easy to set up a blog, why not try to sometimes write about issues that matter to me? I do have quite a number of interests; I hope this doesn't put off people who are only interested in the one or the other aspect. After all, that's what those nifty categories are there for.

I am a German native speaker, but I try to convince myself that I will target a broader audience with English. That said, depending on my mood or the topic at hand, German may make its appearance sometimes. (Who knows what's going to happen anyway?)

If the design of the blog doesn't suit your tastes, you're not alone - neither does it suit mine. I am, however, much too lazy (and too incompetent a designer) to change that. At least for the moment.

*P.S.*: The title of this entry has probably nothing to do with its contents. It's just that Latin always sounds so *insightful*.
