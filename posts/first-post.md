I've been thinking for some time about setting up a blog now.

There have been quite some opportunities where I've wanted to share some insights or interesting thoughts with the world and where I thought &mdash; *if only I had a blog, I'd write about this.* Only I didn't. Until now.

I do have quite a number of interests - linguistics, programming, music, politics, you name it; I hope this doesn't put off people who are only interested in the one or the other aspect. I'll group the blog entries into categories in case this helps.

I'm not yet quite decided on the language issues. English is undoubtedly going to reach a larger audience; the question is whether I do have such an international audience at all; most of my friends speak German and not all of them are that comfortable with reading English. I will probably decide on a case-by-case basis in which language to blog.

This is going to be new territory for me, but I'll try to do my best.

**P.S.** I chose the title of this entry solely out of love for pretentious Latin phrases.

**P.P.S.** The blogging engine I'm using (and, coincidentally, the hoster &mdash; at least for the time being) is the nice, very geeky [ruhoh](http://ruhoh.com) platform. It works as easily as editing my entries with [vim](http://www.vim.org) using [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown) and pushing the changes to [github](https://github.com).
