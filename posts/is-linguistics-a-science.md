My first real blog post is going to be somewhat philosophical.

Recently I've come across an [article](http://www.arachnoid.com/psychology/) in which the author argues that psychology is, as a field, not scientific.

I don't want to debate this specific article, mainly because I am in no way qualified to judge the state of the field under consideration. But what struck me was the many parallels I could see when compared to linguistics.

In linguistics as well we have (and have had) a proliferation of fashions, theories and trends and this has only become more pronounced in the last couple of decades. Some have all but fallen out of use (who remembers [tagmemics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagmemics)?), others have been abandoned by their creators but are still actively used ([Government and Binding](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_and_binding_theory) comes to mind), and a plethora of frameworks still survives to the present day (Minimalism, FG, LFG, HPSG, CG, RCG, RRG, you name it). And this is just considering models of syntactic theory; in semantics, pragmatics, discourse theory, morphology or even phonology (say, [Optimality Theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimality_theory)) we find a similar situation &mdash; although not quite so pronouncedly, since syntax has traditionally been the place where most &ldquo;linguistic wars&rdquo; took place.

Similarly, linguistics as a field lacks an underlying, unifying theory. Of course there have been proposals &mdash; [Universal Grammar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Grammar) had exactly this goal in mind &mdash; but none of them has provided us with empirically testable hypotheses.

If we take &ldquo;science&rdquo; to mean a field of study that rigorously employs the [scientific method](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method) &mdash; that is, that systematically develops hypotheses and designs experiments to empirically test them &mdash; we find that *parts* of linguistic research can be conducted in a scientific way (for example, we may investigate whether male speakers are more likely to use the gerund ending *-in'*, as opposed to the form *-ing* than women are), but the core questions of linguistics &mdash; how do humans actually produce and understand language &mdash; don't seem to be amenable to this kind of empirical research.

So where does that leave us?

Well, all language processing happens in the brain, so we can very well turn to the neurosciences and ask them to answer these questions for us. To my knowledge (which is fairly limited in this domain) we don't understand the biological mechanisms of language processing very well yet, but it is possible that some day we will find answers and develop empirically testable hypotheses for how language actually *works*. Would this then invalidate traditional linguistic research, all those nifty formalisms and terms? Would we then have to throw out nouns and verbs, accusatives and datives, evidentials and aspect markers, as if they were relics of a pre-scientific period?

Well, I do not think so. We don't really *want* to think of language as neurons firing signals somewhere in the brain, or whatever model neuroscientific research would propose. This would be needlessly complicated, and more importantly, this doesn't match in the slightest bit how we humans actually think about languages.

I therefore maintain that linguistic theory should not so much be concerned about how languages *really* work, but much more about how we can most reasonably *think of* how they work. This would make linguistics a classical humanities subject in which the primary method of study is *hermeneutics* and in which the goal is not to accumulate knowledge, but to gain a deep understanding, which, of course, will be partly subjective and always incomplete (and this is, coincidentally, why it is important for linguists to be aware of the wide range of linguistic diversity in the world; only by expanding our knowledge of what is already there can we start asking questions that we wouldn't otherwise think about).

To give an example: We would not have to worry about whether speakers of the world's languages have some kind of distinction between nouns and verbs hardwired in their brains; we instead ask the question: does conceptualizing language as having nouns and verbs deepen our understanding of how languages work? And notice that the answer doesn't have to be *yes* or *no*, it could also be: *it depends*.

Another aspect which highlights this issue is that we think of grammars as static systems (and describe them as such) whereas language, as we all know, is in a constant state of flux. English lost most of its morphology in the course of its history, and the flexible, unconstrained word order of Latin fossilized in its descendant languages, but both of these changes didn't happen over night, and there have been periods of shift where no rigid theory or model could accomodate for the linguistic facts.

Note that I'm not claiming we should ignore biological facts about the brain (or other inputs &mdash; say, from evolutionary anthropology) or that we should stop conducting empirical research in linguistics; all those data *can* (and *should*) inform the way we reason about language, and lend more plausibility to some theories than to others. 

I am now at the end of this blog entry and I don't know whether I convinced anybody; I don't even know whether I convinced myself. In any case I would like to hear some comments on the subject; *especially* from people who don't agree with what I've said here.
