I am currently reviewing some topics for my final exams next week. I thought it might be interesting to share some of this with other people.

Today I want to talk about *spatial relativity*, that is, the ways in which spatial reasoning is influenced by the language we speak.

This is an interesting topic for a number of reasons: first, it's something not only most non-linguists, but probably also many linguists haven't yet heard about; second, space and orientation are so fundamental to our lives that it may seem hard to believe there's anything particularly relative about it;<a href="#fn1" id="top1" class="fn-link">1</a>
and third, spatial relativity affects non-linguistic reasoning, grammar and cultural patterns and its study therefore has to combine fields as diverse as cognitive linguistics, linguistic typology and linguistic anthropology.

### Absolute and relative systems ###
I want to begin with a thought experiment. Suppose you're standing in front of a table onto which a line of three toy animals have been placed, all facing left. You then turn around 180Â° to face another table. Given the same three objects you are asked to reconstruct the configuration you have seen previously. Would the animals be facing left or right?

Well, of course this isn't a proper test. By describing the experiment setup in terms of *left* and *right*, I have already influenced your decision, so you would be very likely to have the animals facing left. But even if you hadn't had to rely on my linguistic description, even if you had just seen the arrangement of the objects for yourself, wouldn't you still have made the same decision, given that this was how the original setup was oriented? If you think so, it will not surprise you that when a very similar experiment was conducted with a number of Dutch speakers, the majority of them (13 out of 15) behaved as you'd have predicted. What might surprise you, though, is that when the same experiment was conducted with speakers from an aboriginal Australian language called *Guugu Yimithirr*, 9 out of 15 actually turned around the orientation of the animals, having them face to the right.<a id="top2" href="#fn2" class="fn-link">2</a>

So what happened here? Are the Guugu Yimithirr speakers just stupid, primitive people that cannot perform even the most simple task correctly? Obviously this is not a very good explanation, so we have to look for a better one. The reason you might want to change the orientation from left to right is that when you turned around, the cardinal direction that was to your left &mdash; let's say, South &mdash; is now to your right. It turns out that the speakers who did this didn't remember the configuration in terms of *left* or *right* (you understand now why it was not scientifically sound to describe the setup in those terms), but of the cardinal directions. We call that first way of conceptualising space a *relative* system, since it is relative to the orientation of the own body, while the second way is an *absolute* system insofar as it always stays the same &mdash; the cardinal directions don't move, after all.

It turns out that cardinal directions are in fact the way spatial relationships are expressed in Guugu Yimithirr. While in languages like English, we use them only for large-scale configurations (such as &ldquo;Italy is South of Germany&rdquo;), in Guugu Yimithirr we would also say &ldquo;the fork is to the South of the spoon&rdquo;. But if Guugu Yimithirr speakers reason about space in absolute terms, those cardinal directions must surely play an important role in their everyday life? Indeed, such has been observed on a number of occasions: For example, on various extended fieldtrips into unknown terrain and with restricted view they were able to point in the direction of important places with a high degree of accuracy.<a id="top3" href="#fn3" class="fn-link">3</a>
Similarly, when narrating stories, their gestures would depend on the locations of the places where the action was supposed to have taken place. Such findings have profound cognitive implications: it means that Guugu Yimithirr speakers must carry around with themselves some sort of *mental map* that they're constantly updating.

The relative and absolute systems are not the only known ways to express spatial configurations. In fact, the Guugu Yimithirr case may be an extreme one. But it turns out that many other linguistic communities around the world use some kind of system based not on the relative orientation of the self, but on some kind of prominent landmark, a hill, a mountain or a river. Such systems would fall in between our strictly relative system and the absolute one used in Guugu Yimithirr.<a href="#fn4" id="top4" class="fn-link">4</a>

### Verticality and linguistic structure ###
The previous discussion showed that linguistic habits and cognitive reasoning influence each other; what I want to talk about now is how the way space is perceived culturally can shape the *structure* of languages.

The Kiranti languages are spoken by a number of linguistic communities on the Himalayas, most of which share a mythological tradition. In this tradition, the element of verticality &mdash; which of course is central to everyday life, given the constant movements up and down the mountains &mdash; plays an important role: the world is conceptually subdivided into three regions, *above*, *below* and *across*, the above region being characterised by notions such as purity, divinity and truth, while the below region is associated with impurity, but is also the place where human beings originated from. This three-way distinction is so salient that it has been inscribed onto the case system of the language, giving rise to so-called *altitudinal cases*. Whereas in English we may say &ldquo;in the house&rdquo;, a Kiranti speaker may say something like &ldquo;up-in the house&rdquo; or &ldquo;below-in the house&rdquo;, depending on the location.

But the importance of verticality has also been noticed in the case of various other communities living in mountain areas, for example in the Swiss Alps. While they haven't developed anything as linguistically remarkable as altitudinal cases, we can nonetheless observe how the need to express spatial configurations very precisely in everyday life gives rise to highly specialised adverbs, such as *up-inside* or *up-straight*.

### Ambiguity in spatial description ###
If we examine more closely how the Kiranti use the up-down opposition to characterise spatial relationships, we find that the picture is more complicated than we might first assume. On the one hand, the general inclination of the Himalayas give rise to an association of *up* with North and *down* with South, therefore an absolute system. But when the inclination of a local hill doesn't correspond to the more general one, the terms can be *overloaded*, describing maybe an East-West opposition instead. And it gets trickier with places of high cultural interest: given the aforementioned positive connotations of the *up* dimension, a significant place like the town Dhankuta, will always be *up*.<a href="#fn5" id="top5" class="fn-link">5</a>

Ambiguities such as these can be resolved only by the context; they go to show that the way space is conceptualised and described in some linguistic communities is highly complex and strongly interrelated with geographical, cultural and mythological knowledge.

### For further reading ###
As I noted earlier, the topic of spatial relativity is a fascinating one and there are really so many other things to tell. In addition, the question of how language and cognition interact (the age-old *Sapir-Whorf hypothesis*) has been studied in a variety of domains besides space, such as colour perception, kinship terminology or gender systems. There is of course a great deal of literature on those subjects, and if you are interested I encourage you to dive into it. 

A light and not strictly scientific book, yet in my opinion still a worthwile and entertaining read, is Guy Deutscher's *Through the Language Glass*, which is however concerned most prominently with colour perception (but includes a discussion of spatial relativity in chapter 7).

For the more theoretically inclined, William A. Foley's *opus magnus*, *Anthropological Linguistics. An Introduction* (in my eyes much more than an introduction) is basically a must read. It includes one chapter on spatial relativity (ch. 11).

Much research on space and cognition has been carried out by the [Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics](http://www.mpi.nl) in Nijmegen. For Guugu Yimithirr see e.g. [this paper](http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:66562:3/component/escidoc:66563/1997_Spatial_description_in_Guugu_Yimithirr.pdf) by Stephen Levinson.

For work on the Kiranti languages see e.g. *Himalayan space. Cultural Horizons and Practices*, edited by Balthasar Bickel and Martin Gaenszle ([introductory chapter](http://www.spw.uzh.ch/bickel-files/papers/BickelGaenszle1999Introduction.pdf)).
