I am currently reviewing some topics for my final exams next week. I thought it might be interesting to share some of this with other people.

Today I want to talk about *spatial relativity*, that is, the ways in which spatial reasoning is influenced by the language we speak.

This is an interesting topic for a number of reasons: first, it's something not only most non-linguists, but probably also many linguists haven't yet heard about; second, space and orientation are so fundamental to our lives that it may seem hard to believe there's anything particularly relative about it; and third, spatial relativity affects non-linguistic reasoning, grammar and cultural patterns and its study therefore has to combine fields as diverse as cognitive linguistics, linguistic typology and linguistic anthropology.

### Absolute and relative systems ###
I want to begin with a thought experiment. Suppose you're standing in front of a table onto a configuration of three objects has been placed. To the right you have a miniature tree, in the middle a house, and to the left a man. You then turn around 180Â° to face another table. Given the same three objects you are asked to reconstruct the configuration you have seen previously. Where would you place the tree, to the left or to the right?

Well, of course this isn't a proper test. By describing the experiment setup in terms of *left* and *right*, I have already influenced your decision, so you would be very likely to place the tree to the left. But even if you hadn't had to rely on my linguistic description, even if you had just seen the arrangement of the objects for yourself, wouldn't you still have placed the tree to the left? I mean, after all, that's just the way the original objects were aligned? If you think so, it will not surprise you that when this experiment<a href="#fn1" id="top1" class="fn-link">1</a>
was conducted with a number of Dutch speakers, the majority of them made exactly that decision. What might surprise you, though, is that when the same experiment was conducted with speakers from an aboriginal Australian language called *Guugu Yimithirr*, they didn't show a particular preference. Some placed the tree to the left, some to the right.

So what happened here? Are the Guugu Yimithirr speakers just stupid, primitive people that cannot perform even the most simple task correctly? Obviously this is not a very good explanation, so we have to look for a better one. The reason you might want to place the object that was to your left to your right now, is that when you turned around, the cardinal direction that was to your left &mdash; let's say, South &mdash; is now to your right. It turns out that the speakers who did this didn't remember the configuration in terms of *left* or *right* (you understand now why it was not scientifically sound to describe the setup in those terms), but of the cardinal directions. We call that first way of conceptualising space a *relative* system, since it is relative to the orientation of the own body, while the second way is an *absolute* system insofar as it always stays the same &mdash; the cardinal directions don't move, after all.

It turns out that cardinal directions are in fact the way spatial relationships are expressed in Guugu Yimithirr. While in languages like English, we use them only for large-scale configurations (such as &ldquo;Italy is South of Germany&rdquo;), in Guugu Yimithirr we would also say &ldquo;the fork is to the South of the spoon&rdquo;. But if Guugu Yimithirr speakers reason about space in absolute terms, those cardinal directions must surely play an important role in their everyday life? Indeed, such has been observed on a number of occasions: For example, on various extended fieldtrips into unknown terrain they were able to point in the direction of important places with a high degree of accuracy. Similarly, when narrating stories, their gestures would depend on the locations of the places where the action was supposed to have taken place. Such findings have profound cognitive implications: it means that Guugu Yimithirr speakers must carry around with themselves some sort of *mental map* that they're constantly updating.

The relative and absolute systems are not the only known ways to express spatial configurations. In fact, the Guugu Yimithirr case may be an extreme one. But it turns out that many other linguistic communities around the world use some kind of system based not on the relative orientation of the self, but on some kind of prominent landmark, a hill, a mountain or a river. Such systems would fall in between our strictly relative system and the absolute one used in Guugu Yimithirr.<a href="#fn2" id="top2" class="fn-link">2</a>

### Verticality and linguistic structure ###
I hope I have brought the point across that linguistic habits and cognitive reasoning influence each other; what I want to talk about now is how the way space is perceived culturally can shape the *structure* of languages.

The Kiranti languages are spoken by a number of linguistic communities on the Himalayas, most of which share a mythological tradition. In this tradition, the element of verticality &mdash; which of course is central to everyday life, characterized by constant movements up and down the mountains &mdash; plays an important role: the world is subdivided into three regions, *above*, *below* and *across*. This three-way distinction is so salient that it has been inscribed onto the case system of the language, giving rise to so-called *altitudinal cases*. Whereas in English we may say &ldquo;in the house&rdquo;, a Kiranti speaker may say something like &ldquo;up-in the house&rdquo; or &ldquo;below-in the house&rdquo;, depending on the location.

But the importance of verticality has also been noticed in the case of various other communities living in mountain areas, for example in the Swiss Alps. While they haven't developed anything as linguistically remarkable as altitudinal cases, we can nonetheless observe how the need to express spatial configurations very precisely in everyday life gives rise to highly specialised adverbs, such as *up-inside* or *up-straight*.

As I noted earlier, the topic of spatial relativity is a fascinating one and there are lots of things to tell; I haven't done more than providing a first, very limited impression. There is a lot of literature where the interested reader, having wet his appetite, can go looking for more on the subject.
