Sometimes people ask me what I'm going to write my master's thesis about.

The reason why I'm most often reluctant to talk about it is not that I don't like the topic. It's that most people expect me to explain my thesis to them in three sentences.

I wonder how often math or physics majors are asked that same question; I have a feeling that this happens a lot less often. Most ordinary people know that those are highly abstract subjects. They wouldn't expect someone to explain them in a few sentences what the Riemann hypothesis is and why this is important (I know this is a bogus example, since proving the Riemann hypothesis in your master's thesis would be quite a feat).

But not so with linguistics. Everyone on this planet speaks at least one language, and many have learned at least one foreign language at some point in their lives. So it is only natural that people expect the study of language to be something fairly concrete, something they can at least partially relate to.

But this is far from the truth. Of course there are a lot of topics in linguistics that are concrete enough to be explained to laymen. I think it would not be too hard to explain to an average-intelligence person that you're investigating the influence French had on English from the period of the Norman conquest on, or how today's language changes by the use of text messaging (note that I'm not claiming they would understand all the results &mdash; just the question being asked). But then linguists also study topics like:

* Lexical categories and voice in Tagalog
* Clause-hierarchy and clause-linking
* Co-compounds and natural coordination

none of which probably make sense to any non-linguist.

Why do linguists employ such strange vocabulary, some may wonder. But asking this question reveals a fundamental : We are so accustomed to speaking our language that we think of the way we form sentences and discourses as natural, maybe as *the way thoughts flow*. Only, it's not. If we examine the breathtaking diversity of the languages of the world, we find that many of them organize their thoughts in radically different ways than we do. Now we could just take these foreign languages and try to describe them in terms of 

Some people learned about grammar in high school. They may have learned about subjects and objects, about nouns and verbs, prepositions and conjunctions. But as abstract as these concepts sound, at least some of them are still too concrete to apply to all languages
